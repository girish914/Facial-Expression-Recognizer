# Facial-Expression-Recognizer
Created a Model that can detect different expressions in a face given their images.
Performed data augmentation on our images to make our model more robust. 
Also performed two phase training on our models, where we have frozen a few layers before our model starts overfitting. 
Also evaluated our model on Test set and applied real time prediction
Project is done with the help of OpenCV for realtime prediction
